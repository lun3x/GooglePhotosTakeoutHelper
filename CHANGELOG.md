## 3.3.5

- Address #178 issues in logs - instructions on what to do

  Sorry but this is all i can do for now :( we may get actual fix if https://github.com/brendan-duncan/archive/pull/244 ever moves further

## 3.3.4

- New name-guess patterns from @matt-boris <3
- Support 19**-s and 18**-s while name guessing
  > First camera was invented in 1839. I don't underestimate you guys anymore :eyes:
- Fix path errors on windoza while unzipping #172
- Fix #175 bad guessing json files with `...(1)` stuff

## 3.3.3

- Fix memory crashes :D
- nicer names for split-to-dates thanks to @denouche #168 <3

## 3.3.2

- Bump SDK and dependencies

## 3.3.1

### Fix bugs introduced in `v3.3.0` 🤓

- #147 Support `.tgz` files too
- #145 **DON'T** use ram memory equal to zip file thanks to `asyncWrite: true` flag 🙃
- #143 don't crash when encoding is other than `utf8` 🍰
- #136 #144 - On windzoa, set time to 1970 if it's before that - would love to *actually* fix this, but Dart doesn't let me :/

## 3.3.0

- Fix #143 - issues when encoding is not utf8 - sadly, others are still not supported, just skipped
- Ask for divide-to-folders in interactive
- Close #138 - support Archive/Trash folders!

  Implementation of this is a bit complicated, so may break, but should work 99% times
- Fix #134 - nicely tell user what to do when no "year folders" instead of exceptions
- Fix #92 - Much better json finding!
  
  It now should find all of those `...-edited(1).jpg.json` - this also makes it faster because it rarely falls back to reading exif, which is slower
- More small fixes and refactors

### Enjoy even faster and more stable `gpth` everyone 🥳🥳🥳

## 3.2.0

- Brand new ✨interactive mode✨ - just double click 🤘
  - `gpth` now uses 💅discontinued💅 [`file_picker_desktop`](https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker_desktop) to launch pickers for user to select output folder and input...
  - ...zips 🤐! because it also decompresses the takeouts for you! (People had ton of trouble of how to join them etc - no worries anymore!)
